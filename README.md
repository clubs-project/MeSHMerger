# MeSHMerger

The MeSHMerger software combines multiple translations of the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesaurus into multilingual term lists.

## How does it work?

MeSH has a three level structure of descriptors, concepts and associated terms. A Descriptor is often broader than a single concept and so may consist of a class of concepts. Concepts, in turn, correspond to a class of terms which are synonymous with each other. If you want to learn more about the MeSH structure, please read the [MeSH relations documentation of the NLM](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshrels.html).

Each descriptor, concept and term has a unique ID. This software aggregates the different term translations from different files under the appropriate concepts and descriptors.
